MainStoryBoard.storyboard contains the declarative XML definition of all the screens in the application; this file is not
present for game-based templates. Xamarin.iOS includes a built-in designer integrated into both IDEs, or you can use
Interface Builder in Xcode. The primary storyboard is identified in the info.plist.
