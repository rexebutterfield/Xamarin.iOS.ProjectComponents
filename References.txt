The References folder contains required compile and runtime assemblies. You can add new assemblies through
context menu by right-clicking on the References folder. Referenced assemblies must either be compatible portable
class libraries, or compiled against Xamarin.iOS. You cannot use desktop .NET assemblies directly.
