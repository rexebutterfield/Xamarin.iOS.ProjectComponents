iOS uses property list files to store application metadata as key/value pairs. Entitlements.plist lists external Apple services
that your app wants to interact with such as in-app purchases, HealthKit or push notifications. Info.plist identifies app
icons, version number, app name and other app details. Both IDEs include a GUI editor for these files to edit the most
common settings.
