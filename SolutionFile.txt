The IDE loads a solution file .sln which contains one or more files .csproj. Each project generates some sort of 
output; typically an executable or library. It uses MSBuild-base projects which can be loaded into Visual Studio
on macOS or Windows. You can switch back and forth between macOS and Windows if desired.
